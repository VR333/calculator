I assume that you have NodeJs and npm installed.
So you need only webpack and webpack-dev-server.
just enter following command to install webpack:
     npm i -g webpack
Enter following command to install webpack-dev-server:
     npm i -g webpack-dev-server

This will install webpack and webpack-dev-server globally due to -g flag.

Next thing to do is navigate to the folder with a project in command line and run following command:
1. npm run calc
